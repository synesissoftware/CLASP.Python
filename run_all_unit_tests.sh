flags/options:

  --help
  shows this help and terminates

  --assume-python2
  uses the python2 command when no -p / --python-cmd-path is given

  --include-python2-in-search
  includes python2 in automatic interpreter discovery (after python3 and python)

  -p <python-cmd-path>
  --python-cmd-path <python-cmd-path>
  specifies explicitly the path of the Python command to be executed (rather than discover it)
